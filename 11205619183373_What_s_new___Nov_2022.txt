What's new - Nov 2022
Features:
1. You can now apply the same sorting to all goals in the report, instead of sorting them one by one.
2.  We have renamed the traffic allocation feature to Experiment Traffic Allocation and Variation Traffic Distribution
3. The report reset option has been moved from stats settings to the report options

4. We have updated our security measures so that when the session expired the app logs users out. This prevents errors and clearly signals that no changes can be made. 
5. Starting Nov 2022, all new projects will automatically come with a faster CDN code (CDN 4 as opposed to CDN 3). This means there will be atleast 20% to 25% improvement in the speed at which the Convert code loads on any site where you choose to use the new snippet.
