Google AMP and Convert Experiences
<h2>Does Convert work in AMP?</h2>
<p>Well, Convert does work in AMP. However, there are some caveats to that.<br><br><strong>Convert can work on AMP sites </strong>if you insert the <strong>Convert</strong> tracking code on it. You will be able to do AB testing on it, but it will not follow the AMP specification.<br><br><strong>Convert </strong>will send data back to Convert using its own script libraries and not the ones specified by AMP.<br><br>However, <strong>Convert</strong> could be used server-side to produce the <strong>AMP-compatible</strong> files that it requires. Please look at the <strong>Convert</strong> <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019498251-Server-Side-Testing-with-PHP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Server Side documentation.</a></p>
