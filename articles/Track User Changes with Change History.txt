Track User Changes with Change History
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Convert logs most actions that can be made in a Project; for example: creating an experiment, modifying a variation, adding and removing audiences, and more. The Change History shows a record of user activity for each of your projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If an experiment seems to behave strangely or stops working correctly, you can troubleshoot by checking the change history to see what changes were made, when they were made, and who they were made by.  This detailed change history creates an activity trail that provides additional security to individuals and teams with multiple collaborators.</p>
<h2>View Project or Experiment Change History</h2>
<p>Go to My Projects dashboard and from there select "Change History":</p>
