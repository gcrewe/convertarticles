Protect your account with Two Factor Authentication
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA) increases the security of a Convert account by adding a second level of authentication when signing in. Instead of relying only on a password, with two factor authentication enabled, you will be required to enter a code that you access from your mobile device. That way you can rest easy, knowing that your account is protected even if your password is compromised.</p>
<p>This article walks you through how to enable and disable two factor authentication in your account settings. </p>
<h2>Enable Two Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Initially, you should download and install the Google Authenticator app for your mobile device. Google Authenticator generates a new code every 30 seconds. When you log into Convert, you will need the most current code to gain access to your account.</p>
<p>Go to "My Profile" option from the right menu:</p>

<p>A verification code will be generated. Enter that in the Verification code field and click the Enable button. That’s it! You have successfully enabled individual two factor authentication.</p>
<h2>Signing in</h2>
<p>After you enable Two Factor Authentication, any time you sign into Convert, you will need to enter the current security code from your Google Authenticator app in addition to your password.</p>
<h2>Disable Two Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>If you no longer want the extra protection provided by two factor authentication, you can disable the feature in your Profile. Just select Disable (instead of Enable).</p>
