Integrate Convert Experiences with Salesforce CRM
<h2>Convert-Salesforce CRM Integration</h2>
<p>Integration of <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/">Salesforce CRM</a> with Convert Experiences is possible through the <a href="https://www.bizible.com/">Bizible</a> Marketing Analytics app/package that is available on Salesforce AppExchange. Bizible helps companies track their marketing activities back to individual customers in Salesforce. This integration will help you to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>see the experiment associated with a lead and a contact in Salesforce. This information updates dynamically as the lead or contact visits the website and is exposed to more experiments.</li>
<li>run reports on this information. Sales teams can now answer<strong> </strong>questions like, does pricing page variation A, B, or C lead to more revenue?</li>
</ol>
<p>For each experiment, the integration can pass along the experiment name/id and variation name/id that the visitor is currently bucketed into.</p>
<h2>Add Bizible on Salesforce AppExchange</h2>
<p>First thing you need to do is to install the Bizible Marketing Analytics package to your Salesforce account. Go to the Setup side of Salesforce:</p>

<p>Then select Installed Packages under Apps</p>
<p><img src="https://support.convert.com/hc/article_attachments/360036767232/mceclip1.png" alt="mceclip1.png"></p>
<p>You can then see on Bizible side if the connection is active:</p>

<h2>Add Tracking Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Then make sure the Convert tracking code is <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205151015-How-to-Install-the-Main-Tag-Code-Javascript">installed</a> on your page.</p>
<p>On every page that you want to install Bizible, paste the code snippet that is found on Bizible Account Configuration.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.convert.com/hc/article_attachments/360021785011/mceclip1.png"></p>
<h2>Send Custom Events</h2>
<p>You should then create the <a href="https://support.bizible.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005058248-Tracking-Custom-Website-Events">custom events</a> you want to send (e.g. Convert Experiment Name and Convert Variation Name that the website visitor is bucketed into). You can send a custom event from anywhere in the page where Convert experiences are running.</p>
<p>Example code for sending Experiment Name and Variation Name:</p>
<pre><code>var refObject = window['convert']['data']['experiments']
        for (var key in window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"]) {
            if (!window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"].hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                continue;
            }}
            
var currentExperiment = window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"][key];
    var curExperimentName = refObject[key] &amp;&amp; refObject[key].n ? refObject[key].n : "unknown experiment name";
    curExperimentName = curExperimentName.replace("Test #", "Test ");
    var curVariant = currentExperiment['variation_name'] ? currentExperiment['variation_name'] : "unknown variant";
    curVariant = curVariant.replace("Var #", "Variation ");

window['Bizible'] = window['Bizible'] || { _queue: [], Push: function (o, p) { this._queue.push({ type: o, data: p }); } }; 
    var reportData = {};
    reportData['Experiment_ID'] = curExperimentName;
    reportData['Variation_ID'] = curVariant;
    Bizible.Push('Event', reportData); </code></pre>
<p>You might need to contact your Bizible Success Manager or email support@bizible.com to enable the Custom Event tracking feature if this is not enabled:</p>
