Define Audiences for your Experience
<h2>What is an Audience?</h2>
<p>An <strong>"Audience"</strong> is a group of visitors that you want to be included in your experience, being an experiment or personalization.</p>
<h2>Audience Dialog Sections</h2>
<p>You can create an audience for your experiment by going to your Experience Summary and locating the Audience section.  From within the Audience section, you can add a previously saved audience or create a new audience. </p>
<p>Clicking on the Add Audience dropdown will give you the following options: 1) Templates or 2) Advanced</p>
<p><strong>Important: Note that the audiences listed in the Audience Dialog section are joined in an OR fashion and not AND.</strong><br><br><img src="https://support.convert.com/hc/article_attachments/6460370092173/mceclip0.png" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
