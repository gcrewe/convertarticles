Integrate Convert Experiences with Drupal
Introduction
 Drupal is a scalable, open platform for web content management and digital experiences.
This integration will allow you to use Convert Experiments A/B Testing on your Drupal powered website.
Create a new experiment
In Experiences screen select "New Experience"

Copy the Convert Experiments Script
Go to your Project Configuration and find the Convert tracking code:

Add Drupal Module
Go to your Drupal account and add the module Header and Footer Scripts. 
Add Convert script into Drupal Module
You can then add the above script into the Drupal Module and then save configurations. This way you will have Convert installed in every page. 
Add Convert Script only to few Pages
If you would like to only install it in few pages This can easily be achieved from a custom module by implementing hook_page_attachments(), checking the page you are on and adding the JS code to the HTML head. 
Sample code can be found here.
Test the Integration
Now, go to the live site and check to see if your experiments are running. The changes you made to the variations or original should appear.
