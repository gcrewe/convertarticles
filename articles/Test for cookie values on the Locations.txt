Test for cookie values on the Locations
<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
<p>Sometimes we may need to check for a specific condition to occur on every page visit, but that condition might be related to the options offered in the Locations.<br><br>A common need is to verify a cookie value for a user to be bucketed into the test, but if this cookie value changes the experience should no longer be shown to the visitor. For example, we might want to show a coupon only one time; or, the opposite.<br><br>What we would need is a <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205159965-Targeting-Experiments-and-Firing-Goals-Based-on-a-JavaScript-Condition">JavaScript Condition</a> that checks for the cookie value and the URL value at the same time.</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>Place the following code in the Locations as a JavaScript condition. Make sure you modify the code with the correct values to check the cookie and the cookie name as specified in the cookie comments.</p>
