What is a Project?
<h2>Project definition</h2>
<p>A project is a way of creating a subsection in your Convert account. Each project has its own snippet, set of experiments, and set of collaborators. Projects are designed to help you organize your experiments across multiple sites (or different sections of large sites). The hierarchy of experiment organization looks like this:</p>

<p>With projects, you can group your experiments in ways that make sense for your organization. For example, if you run experiments on multiple domains, you can assign a unique project for each domain. You can also invite other users to collaborate on a project without allowing them complete access to your account. </p>
<h2>Things to know before creating a Project</h2>
<p>Some things you need to know about how a project behaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each project has a unique JavaScript code, this code splits the databases of clients and ensures website visitor information is private and never reusable in another project.</li>
<li>Each project can have unlimited experiments, goals and domains in it.</li>
<li>Inside a Project, an experiment can include websites with different domains as long as the same JavaScript code is pasted in the header of each website inside the project.</li>
<li>When a project is deleted all data will be purged from our servers within 7 days and is unrecoverable after that time.</li>
<li>When a project is deleted the visitor cookies will be unable to reconnect to any new project you set up on the same domain.</li>
<li>Each plan has a maximum number of projects you can create. For reference please check <a href="https://www.convert.com/pricing/" target="_self">here</a>.</li>
