Integrate Convert Experiences with Plausible
Introduction
Plausible.io is a privacy-friendly analytics service that is an attractive alternative to Google Analytics. It only stores data that enables a simple analysis of visits to your website. In doing so, Plausible does not track the user across multiple websites (does not store cross-site cookies).
With the Convert-Plausible integration, unique visitors to your experiments’ variations will be passed into Plausible using custom event goals.

Add Tracking Codes
To set up the integration, you should install the Plausible tracking code according to their instructions. It looks like this:

You should also install the Convert tracking code (instructions can be found here).

Custom Event Goals
Create a Plausible custom event goal. 
Example of the data we send to Plausible:current Experiment Name*, current Variation*
* Depends on whether you have chosen data anonymization or not (more information on this can be found here)

Enable the Integration Manually
This example code can send Experiment and Variation names to your Plausible goal:
var refObject = window['convert']['data']['experiments']
			for (var key in window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"]) {
				if (!window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"].hasOwnProperty(key)) {
					continue;
				}}
            
		var currentExperiment = window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"][key];
		var curExperimentName = refObject[key] && refObject[key].n ? refObject[key].n : "unknown experiment name";
		curExperimentName = curExperimentName.replace("Test #", "Test ");
		var curVariant = currentExperiment['variation_name'] ? currentExperiment['variation_name'] : "unknown variant";
		curVariant = curVariant.replace("Var #", "Variation ");
		
	plausible('Convert', {props: {Experiment: curExperimentName}});
	plausible('Convert', {props: {Variation: curVariant}});
View Convert Data in Plausible
Once you enable the integration you can view Experiment ID, Variation ID in Plausible dashboard:
