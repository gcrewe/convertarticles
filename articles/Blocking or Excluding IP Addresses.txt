Blocking or Excluding IP Addresses
<h2>Blocking IPs in Convert</h2>
<p>This feature allows you to block tracking on certain IPs or ranges of IPs. You can include your own office IPs or ranges to prevent them triggering goals or visits and showing them on the reports of your experiments. This will prevent contamination of your experiment data.</p>
<p>You can enable the blocking for the all the projects under your account or just a specific project. </p>
<p>When you block or unblock an IP or range of IPs, it generally takes about 5 minutes to take effect. </p>
<p><em>Note: When you block your IP, you will be bucketed into the experiment but your visit or conversions won’t be shown on the report.</em></p>
<h2>Account Block</h2>
<p>This type of block will be enabled for all the experiments and projects under your account. However, it will not include projects shared with you, only the ones you own.</p>
<p>Go to your Account Settings menu and select Blocked IPs.</p>

<h2>Domain-Based Blocking</h2>
<p>Convert does not allow for domain-based blocking. You will need to rely on IP domain blocking to stop the Convert script from registering your visits and conversions from the desired location.</p>
