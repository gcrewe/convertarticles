Preventing Flicker in Cloudflare Rocket Loader Integration
According to Cloudflare Rocket Loader's documentation, it prioritizes your websiteâ€™s content (text, images, fonts, and more) by deferring the loading of all of your JavaScript until after rendering.
This could cause a delay in loading our Convert Snippet and result in a noticeable flicker effect.
To avoid this, we recommend including the attribute data-cfasync="false" to our snippet.
For instance, if the snippet appears as follows:
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn-4.convertexperiments.com/js/12345678-12345678.js"></script>
The updated snippet would look like this:
<script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript" src="//cdn-4.convertexperiments.com/js/12345678-12345678.js"></script>
By doing so, Rocket Loader will ignore our Convert snippet while optimizing the loading of other scripts on the page, as per the Rocket Loader documentation:
