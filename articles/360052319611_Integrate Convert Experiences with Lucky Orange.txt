Integrate Convert Experiences with Lucky Orange
Convert-Lucky Orange Integration
Whether you are improving your clients websites’ or working to close your next deal, keying in on insights to improve conversions is powerful. Through the integration of  Lucky Orange and Convert, your A/B visitors will be automatically synced to Lucky Orange’s dynamic heatmaps, session recordings and chat logs. This gives you unmatched insight for each of your customers and prospects which is easily accessible in your Convert report dashboards.
For each experiment, the integration uses custom events to pass along the experiment name and variation name that the visitor is currently bucketed into.
Add Tracking Code Snippets
Make sure the Convert tracking code and the Lucky Orange code are installed on your page. Once you have added the codes to your website, you will be able to use the Lucky Orange account to start replaying user sessions and gain insights.  
Activate Convert-Lucky Orange Integration 
Add the code below to your Global Project Javascript under Project > Configuration  which will send Convert Experience and Variation ids to Lucky Orange Dashboard. This will send the experiments and variations the visitor is bucketed on as an event in Lucky Orange. This can be customized to suit your needs.
