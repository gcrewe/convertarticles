What's New in Convert as of March 1, 2018
<p> </p>
<p>We have made new optional Privacy changes to help our customers who need to be GDPR compliant:</p>
<h2>DO NOT TRACK</h2>
<p>We added configurable support for Browser "Do Not Track" settings by Project. By default, the OFF option is selected when you create a new Project, but you may choose from any of the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>OFF</li>
<li>EU Only</li>
<li>EEA Only</li>
<li>Worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2>CROSS-DOMAIN LINKING</h2>
<p>When creating a new Project, the configurable option for disallowing Cross Domain Linking is now ON by default.</p>
