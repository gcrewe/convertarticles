Integrate Convert Experiences with RudderStack
Convert-Rudderstack Integration
RudderStack is an open-source, warehouse-first customer data platform (CDP) that builds your CDP on your data warehouse for you. It provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.
For each experiment, the integration uses semantic track events to pass along the experiment name and variation name that the visitor is currently bucketed into (if any).
Add Tracking Code Snippets
Make sure the Convert tracking code and the RudderStack tracking code (rudder-analytics.js) are installed on your page. You will need your Write Key and Data Plane URL that you can find in your Rudderstack account:

Send Events to RudderStack
The example code below is using the track API call and will send Convert Experience and Variation names to RudderStack. This can be inserted inside Convert on the Project > Configuration > Project Global Javascript and will be appended to the page, before any experiment is evaluated and executed after the variations have been decided.
/* Push Convert data to external tracking tool */function afterVariationsDecidedActions(){console.log('afterVariationDecidedActions() called');var exp = convert.currentData.experiments;var number_of_experiments = Object.keys(exp).length;var loop_counter = 0;for (var expID in exp){// Next Line is where the code to send the // data goesrudderanalytics.track('Convert Experiences', {Exp_Name: expID,Var_Name: exp[expID].variation_id});console.log('Convert is sending data for the following experiment/variation to your third party too: '+expID+','+exp[expID].variation_id)}}_conv_q = window._conv_q || [];_conv_q.push({what: 'addListener',params: {event: 'snippet.experiences_evaluated',handler: (event) => afterVariationsDecidedActions()}})
View Convert Data in RudderStack
Using a semantic event in RudderStack, you will be able to view all of your Convert Experiences data as they associate to the values that you pass in the event.
When you log in to your RudderStack account, you should go to your Live Events. There, you can see all of the track events that you are sending through RudderStack.
