Integrate Convert Experiences with Webflow
Webflow is a SaaS application that allows designers to build responsive websites with browser based visual editing software. 
This article will guide you on how to set up Convert A/B testing with your Webflow designed websites. You can run simple A/B experiments on any Webflow site, and it does most of the technical work (like splitting traffic) for you.
Here are some simple steps to get started with this integration:

Sign up for a Convert.com plan

Find your Convert tracking script and copy it to your clipboard
Go to your Webflow project's project settings → custom code tab. Paste the code you copied in the head code section. Make sure to include the opening and closing <script> tags! To be able to use the custom code you need to have a paid Webflow account.

Save the changes and publish your Webflow project.
Go back to the Convert dashboard and create your first A/B test!


Your Convert dashboard will monitor performance and let you know how each variant does.
