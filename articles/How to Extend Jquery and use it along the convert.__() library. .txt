How to Extend Jquery and use it along the convert._$() library. 
<h2>Sample Use Case</h2>
<p>Let say that we want to test loading new images from a different CDN of what we currently use to see if this affects conversion.</p>
<p>We need to set up an AB experiment in which the new CDN is reflected on all the images that we want to load from the other service.Â </p>
<p>This is just for illustrative purposes. The code has been tested, but not in a real case scenario. It is shown here so anybody can create their own Jquery libraries that work along with Convert.</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The following code extends the convert version of jquery and then users in on the convert._$ wrapper library:</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="313" data-theme-id="31058" data-slug-hash="OoqoWr" data-default-tab="js" data-user="gcrewe" data-pen-title="Extend Jquery and use with convert._$()">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gcrewe/pen/OoqoWr/">Extend Jquery and use with convert._$()</a> by Convert.com (<a href="https://codepen.io/gcrewe">@gcrewe</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
