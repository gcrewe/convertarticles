How to track revenue using GTM
<h2>Track revenue with GTM</h2>
<p>You can utilize Google Tag Manager to insert the HTML code to track revenue in Convert. This can be inserted as a GTM tag. With GTM you might not need the help of your webmaster or IT department to track revenue.</p>
<p>However, you would still need to map your e-commerce revenue variables to the Convert variables. You can read more about it on: <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/204495499-Add-Revenue-Tracking-to-Your-Site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Add Revenue Tracking to Your Site"</a> article.</p>
<p>Once you got the variables mapped and your code snippet, you can create your GTM tag.</p>
<p>If you use an already available e-commerce integration, you might not need to do this. As this is already done for you on many of those integrations. Check your integration to see if it includes revenue tracking.</p>
<h2>Configure the GTM Tag</h2>
