			if (!window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"].hasOwnProperty(key)) {
				continue;
	}}
            
var currentExperiment = window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"][key];
var curExperimentName = refObject[key] &amp;&amp; refObject[key].n ? refObject[key].n : "unknown experiment name";
curExperimentName = curExperimentName.replace("Test #", "Test ");
var curVariant = currentExperiment['variation_name'] ? currentExperiment['variation_name'] : "unknown variant";
curVariant = curVariant.replace("Var #", "Variation ");
		
jump('send', 'automation', 'trigger', '123abc123456a12a1a123456', curVariant);  </code></pre>
