Experiment based on page content
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we would like to implement an experiment based on the page content, instead of URL or Page Tag conditions.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>For this we will implement a JS Condition to look for the content on the page using JQuery and if found it will bucket the visitor on the experiment if he/she visits any page with such content.<br> <br> For this solution to work, you will need to create the CSS selector for the element that needs to be present on the page, to enable the experiment.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre>(function() {<br> if(document.readyState === 'complete'){<br>   return(false)}<br> else if(convert.$('.selector').length == 0) {<br>   convert_recheck_experiment();<br> }<br> else return (true);<br>})()</pre>
