Integrate Convert Experiences with Active Campaign
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Integrating <a href="https://www.convert.com/integrations/active-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Active Campaign</a> with Convert Experiences allows you to send Convert data in the Active Campaign and segment your contacts based on Convert values.</p>
<p>For each experiment, the integration will pass along the experiment name and variation name that the Visitor is currently bucketed into (if any). </p>
<p><span>For more use cases regarding this integration you can read our </span><a href="https://www.convert.com/blog/optimization/activecampaign-convert-follow-ups-that-increase-conversions/" target="_self" rel="undefined">Active Campaign blog article</a><span>.</span></p>

<h2>Enable Active Campaign Event Tracking</h2>
<p>Next, you should enable your Active Campaign Event Tracking by following these <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/how-to-setup-activecampaign-event-tracking/">instructions</a>. </p>
<h2>Add the Integration Code</h2>
<p>Copy this code, <strong>after</strong> the two tracking codes, to activate the integration:</p>
<pre><code>var refObject = window['convert']['data']['experiments']
	for (var key in window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"]) {
			if (!window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"].hasOwnProperty(key)) {
				continue;
	}}
            
    var currentExperiment = window["convert"]["currentData"]["experiments"][key];
    var curExperimentName = refObject[key] &amp;&amp; refObject[key].n ? refObject[key].n : "unknown experiment name";
    curExperimentName = curExperimentName.replace("Test #", "Test ");
    var curVariant = currentExperiment['variation_name'] ? currentExperiment['variation_name'] : "unknown variant";
    curVariant = curVariant.replace("Var #", "Variation ");
    
    
    // your ActiveCampaign id. You can get this from your AC settings 
    var actid = "1000077108"; 

    // your event key, also in AC settings
    var eventKey = "93f120c55fa6caf9dabc1430d8b4232efead5dfe"; 
    
    // Name for event you want to track.
    var event = "Convert Experiences Variation Name";
    
    var eventData = curVariant;
    
    
    // build the eventString based on the variables you just edited above ☝
    var eventString = "actid=" + actid 
                    + "&amp;key=" + eventKey 
                    + "&amp;event=" + event 
                    + "&amp;eventdata" + eventData;

  // send the event to the ActiveCampaign API with our event values
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.open("POST", "https://trackcmp.net/event", true);
  xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
  xhttp.send(eventString);</code></pre>
<h2>Verify Installation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to verify that your integration code is correctly installed is to go to <strong>Tracking</strong> and then <strong>Event Tracking</strong> and see your new event in the list:</p>
