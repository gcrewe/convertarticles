Experiment Report
<h2>Understand Experience Report</h2>
<p><span>Deriving meaningful insights from your experiences and applying them to improve your website conversion rate is your experiences' ultimate objective. The experience reports help you validate the hypothesis you test and derive a better understanding of your website's visitor behavior.</span> </p>
<p><span>To access your test report, select the experience for which you want to view the report, and go to the <strong>REPORT</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>You will be able to see 4 different sections</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Top Menu</li>
<li>Summary</li>
<li>Variations</li>
<li>Goals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals section</h2>
<p>In the goals section, you can see all the goals of the experience and some interesting stats and graphs that we are going to analyze below. Before that, we need to explain a few tags/terms that you might see and not recognize.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Default Goal</strong>: If you see the term Default Goal next to one of your goals that means it is one of the <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205160365-What-is-Increase-Engagement-and-Decrease-Bouncerate-" target="_self">2 default goals</a> we add to every experience</li>
<li>
<strong>Primary Goal</strong>: This can only be one and is decided by you. It is the most important goal for your experience. This will be shown first on the goals list and <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205160485-What-Status-Options-do-an-Experiment-or-Test-Have-" target="_self">experience status</a> will be changed based on this.</li>
<li>
<strong>SRM</strong>: <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412567998221-What-is-SRM-" target="_self">Potential Sample Ratio Mismatch</a> detected on your test and you need to contact <a href="mailto:support@convert.com">support@convert.com</a> or check the experience setup.</li>
<li>
<strong>Baseline</strong>: By default, is your <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205160445-What-is-a-Baseline-" target="_self">experience baseline</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<p><img src="https://support.convert.com/hc/article_attachments/7011465825165/mceclip3.png" alt="mceclip3.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Variation Name</strong>: name of your variation. Next to it, there is a checkbox that you can enable/disable to show or hide the variation stats on the graph</li>
<li>
<strong>Improvement</strong>: <span>this column reports the percentage change of the variation compared to the Original. </span>When computed confidence is greater than the confidence set in the stats settings the color changes
<ul>
<li>Red for -</li>
<li>Green for +</li>
<li>Gray for other </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Visitors</strong>: t<span>he amount of total bucketed visitors in the experience. These are unique visitors.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conversions</strong>: t<span>his represents the total conversions for each goal/variation</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conversion Rate</strong>: <span>this column shows the percentage of visitors that turned into conversions</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Confidence Level (statistical significance)</strong>: this column reports the significance, or how different the confidence interval for the conversion rate for the experiment variation is when compared to the original. If the confidence is not showing any number, this is because (by default) there is a minimum of 5 conversions needed<span> </span><span class="wysiwyg-underline">for each variation</span><span> </span>in order to calculate it. It also must meet the minimum visitors set<span> </span><span class="wysiwyg-underline">for each variation</span>. If you have changed the minimum conversions then the minimum you chose would have to be met. The gray/green dots in that column indicate: 
<ul>
<li>1 green dot for 75%-85% confidence</li>
<li>2 green dots for 85%-95% confidence</li>
<li>3 green dots for 95%-96% confidence</li>
<li>4 green dots for 96%-97% confidence</li>
<li>5 green dots for 97% and above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Box Plot/Confidence Interval</strong>: <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205160375-What-is-Statistical-Confidence-" target="_self">range of values where the true conversion rate falls</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Status</strong>: <a href="https://support.convert.com/hc/en-us/articles/205160485-What-Status-Options-do-an-Experiment-or-Test-Have-" target="_self">status</a> of the variation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphs</h3>
<p>There are three available groups of graphs that are explained below:</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Conversions Over Time</strong>: Y axis shows conversions, X axis shows time, the lines are one for each variation (conversions) + one for conversions of the whole experiment (average conversions of all variations) + a second axis Y at the right which represent the cumulative number of conversions inside the whole experiment. </span></li>
<li>
<strong>Daily Conversion Rate Over Time</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: non cumulative conversion rate - same as graph <strong>Conversion Rate Over Time</strong>, only that we do not show a second Y axis with cumulative visitors and the non cumulative is used for the API</span>
</li>

<strong>Products Per Visitor</strong>: cumulative average ordered products per visitor - Y axis shows average ordered products per visitor, X axis shows time, the lines are one for each variation (cumulative average ordered products per visitor) + one for average ordered products per visitor of the whole experiment (average of all variations) + a second axis Y at the right which represent the cumulative number of visitors inside the whole experiment</li>
<li>

<strong>Revenue over Time</strong>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulative average revenue per visitor - Y axis shows average revenue per visitor, X axis shows time, the lines are one for each variation (average revenue per visitor) + one for average revenue per visitor of the whole experiment (average of all variations) + a second axis Y at the right which represent the cumulative number of visitors inside the whole experiment</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daily Revenue Per Visitor</strong>: </span></span>non cumulative average revenue per visitor</li>
