Track SKU products or subscriptions separately in Shopify
You can create a goal that would fire only when a product with a certain SKU is purchased.For this, you would need to install the following JavaScript code in the same way that the manual revenue tracking is installed on Shopify. You could append the code along the manual revenue tracking code, making a goal for general revenue tracking and one for a specific SKU. You would only need to change the id, to the revenue goal that you create for this on the Convert app.
<script>total_sku_revenue = 0;total_sku_products = 0;function reportRevenue(revenue,product_count) {    _conv_q = window._conv_q || [];    // Replace the number for your Revenue Goal Id    _conv_q.push(["pushRevenue", revenue, product_count, "100134184"]);    console.log('SKU Specific Report:revenue='+revenue+': Product Count='+product_count);}Shopify.checkout.line_items.forEach(product => {  if (product.sku.includes('rose')){    total_sku_revenue = product.line_price + total_sku_revenue;          total_sku_products =  1 + total_sku_products;  }})if (total_sku_products > 0) {reportRevenue(total_sku_revenue,total_sku_products)}total_sku_revenue = 0;total_sku_products = 0;function reportRevenue(revenue,product_count) {    _conv_q = window._conv_q || [];    // Replace the number for your Revenue Goal Id    _conv_q.push(["pushRevenue", revenue, product_count, "100134184"]);    console.log('SKU Specific Report:revenue='+revenue+': Product Count='+product_count);}Shopify.checkout.line_items.forEach(product => {  if (product.sku.includes('rose')){    total_sku_revenue = product.line_price + total_sku_revenue;          total_sku_products =  1 + total_sku_products;  }})if (total_sku_products > 0) {reportRevenue(total_sku_revenue,total_sku_products)}</script>
To separate subscriptions from non-subscriptions you can use the following code:
<script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {// change the next line with true if you need currency conversionconvertRevenueCurrency = false;currencyToConvertTo = 'USD';function reportRevenue(revenue, product_count, goal_id, purchase_type, Currency) {_conv_q = window._conv_q || [];// Enable next line if currency conversion is needed.if (convertRevenueCurrency) {revenue = Currency.convert(revenue, Shopify.checkout.currency, currencyToConvertTo);}_conv_q.push(["pushRevenue", revenue, product_count, goal_id]);console.log(purchase_type + ' Report:revenue=' + revenue + ': Product Count=' + product_count);}const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET', 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/javascripts/currencies.js');xhr.onload = function() {console.log('xhr status' + xhr.status);if (xhr.status === 200) {eval(xhr.responseText);total_subs_revenue = 0;total_subs_products = 0;total_non_subs_revenue = 0;total_non_subs_products = 0;Shopify.checkout.line_items.forEach(product => {if (product.variant_title.includes('Subscription')) {total_subs_revenue = product.line_price + total_subs_revenue;total_subs_products = 1 + total_subs_products;} else {total_non_subs_revenue = product.line_price + total_non_subs_revenue;total_non_subs_products = 1 + total_non_subs_products;}})if (total_subs_products > 0) {// Change goal id to the one created for subscriptionsreportRevenue(total_subs_revenue, total_subs_products, '10044705', 'subscriptions', Currency);}if (total_non_subs_products > 0) {// Change goal id to the one created for non subscriptionsreportRevenue(total_non_subs_revenue, total_non_subs_products, '10044706', 'non subscription', Currency);}}};xhr.send();});</script>
