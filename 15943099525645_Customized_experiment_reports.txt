Customized experiment reports
In May 2023, Convert released the Customize Reports feature. 
 
This feature allows you to do the following:
1. Report report sections, so that insights that are of most value to you can be presented first.
2. Show/Hide sections in the report that are relevant to your tracking analysis.
 
This feature can be accessed by going into the Experiment report and clicking on the Customize button.

 
This will then open a configuration panel for you where you can re-order the different report sections and also show/hide them according to your preferences.

So checkout this new feature and share your thoughts in the comment section!
