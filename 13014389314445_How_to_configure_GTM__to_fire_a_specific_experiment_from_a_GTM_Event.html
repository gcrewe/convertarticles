How to configure GTM  to fire a specific experiment from a GTM Event
First, you need to create a custom HTML tag in GTM. This tag will contain the manual activation code.
In the custom HTML tag, paste the following code:

window.runExperiment = 1;
_conv_q = window._conv_q || [];
_conv_q.push(["executeExperiment","{{experiment_id_here}}"]);

Replace {{experiment_id_here}} with the actual experiment ID from Convert Experiences.


Next, you need to create a GTM trigger that will fire the custom HTML tag.


In the trigger configuration, select the type of trigger you want to use. For example, you may want to use a custom event trigger if you want to fire the experiment when a specific event occurs on the page.

Add a JS Condition to the Site Area of your experiment with window.runExperiment == 1;


Finally, publish the changes in GTM to activate the experiment on your website.


That's it! You have now successfully configured GTM to fire the manual activation code from a GTM Event.
